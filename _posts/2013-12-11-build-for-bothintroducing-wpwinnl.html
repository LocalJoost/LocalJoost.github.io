<p><font size="4">Intro</font></p> <p>As I alluded to in a few previous posts, I have been working on a merged version of both my <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/?ocid=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939&amp;WT.mc_id=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939">Windows Phone</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview?ocid=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939&amp;WT.mc_id=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939" target="_blank">Windows 8</a> libraries on Codeplex: <a href="http://wp7nl.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">wp7nl</a> and <a href="http://win8nl.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">win8nl</a>. I have now come to the point that I think it is ready for use and/or some community feedback, so I just released <a href="http://wpwinnl.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">WpWinNl</a> to CodePlex and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/WpWinNl/" target="_blank">NuGet</a>. The first ‘good’ version is 1.0.1, immediately superseded by 1.0.3 containing the new cross platform <a href="http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2013/12/building-for-both-tapsendbluetooth.html" target="_blank">DevicePairConnectHelper</a>. </p> <p>I’ve cut some old stuff that merely introduced dependencies and that no-one used anyway, and I ported stuff that was missing in Win8nl from Windows Phone and back. Provided it makea sense – since there is no FlipView in Windows Phone, I did not port the <a href="http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2012/08/a-winrt-behavior-to-turn-flipview-into.html" target="_blank">FlipViewPanoramaBehavior</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p>People may be shocked to see that it is mainly a <em>Windows 8.1 </em>project, and that the Windows Phone project contains mainly links. No, I am not trying leave Windows Phone – I just found out that most Windows 8 code compiles unchanged on Windows Phone, but not the other way around. See the <a href="http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2013/11/build-for-both-reflection-bits-pieces.html" target="_blank">things that I ran into when I was porting reflection-riddle code</a> – it’s better to bite the bullet on Windows 8, then Windows Phone usually follows suit. The investment the Phone team made moving to a common kernel really pays off that way</p> <p>It is still a work in progress, as any good library should be. </p> <p><font size="4">FAQ</font></p> <ul> <li>What? Are you abandoning Windows Phone 7?  <ul> <li><em>Yup. Sorry. Gotta move forward. I push you forward into the new era whether you want it or not ;-) . Seriously, I have enough #ifdef code as it is now. And for those that don’t want to go along – the old library wp7nl still exists, and most of the code will still compile under Windows Phone 7. </em></li></ul> <li>What? Only support for Windows 8.1, no Windows 8 anymore?  <ul> <li><em>Yup. See previous question. </em></li></ul> <li>Is this fully and thoroughly tested?  <ul> <li><em>Nope. This is the tool I needed to make to make cross-platform apps myself. I will probably run into errors. So will you. Contributions and fixes are accepted</em></li></ul> <li>You are now the only dev registered on the project. Are you taking sole control of the project again?  <ul> <li><em>Don’t be silly – if you want to contribute as a developer, just let me know. I just did not get around to adding the people that contributed to the ‘parent projects’. </em></li></ul> <li>Why only platform specific libraries? Why not PCL?  <ul> <li><em>Most of the code I write makes at some point use of the System.Windows or the Windows.UI.Xaml namespace. That does not fit into PCL anyway, so at this point I think the benefits of having PCL do not outweigh the extra hassle of having source code in <strong>three</strong> potential spots.</em></li></ul></li></ul> <p>Enjoy!</p>
