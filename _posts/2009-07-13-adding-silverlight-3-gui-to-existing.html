This is extremely easy. <a href="http://blog.smarx.com/">Steve Marx</a> points out in a comment on <a href="http://nickeandersson.blogs.com/blog/2008/11/windows-azure-how-i-deployed-an-existing-silverlight-application-in-30-minutes.html">this blog post</a>:

<blockquote>To add a Silverlight project to a Web Role project, simply right-click your project file in the solution explorer and select "Properties". In the Project properties view, the bottom-most tab on the left is "Silverlight Applications" - select this, and there is an "Add..." button that allows you to add (and configure) a new or existing Silverlight app to your web role.</blockquote>

And that is really all there is to it. I've tried this with a Silverlight 3 project but since the comment is from december 2008 I have every reason to believe this works for Silverlight 2.0 projects as well. Not that I can think of <em>any</em> reason to stick with 2.0... but that's another story ;-)
