<h2>Intro</h2><p>To be honest, the title of this blog post is a bit weird, because in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality" target="_blank"><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Toolkit</a> 1 the concept of grabbing was unknown, as HoloLens 1 does not support this kind of gestures. But nevertheless, as I am on this quest of documenting all the gems I discover while migrating an existing app to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality" target="_blank">Mixed Reality</a> Toolkit 2, this is one of the things I came across so I am shoehorning it in this blog post series – the 8th installment of it already. And the fun thing about this one if that although there is a <a href="https://github.com/LocalJoost/MRTK2GrabDemo">demo project</a> available, I am going to write no code at all. The whole concept of manipulation by grabbing can be done by simply dragging MRTK2 components on top of a game object.</p><h2>'Far manipulation'</h2><p>This is really extremely simple. If I want to make a cube draggable in the 'classic' sense - that is, point a cursor to it, pinch and move my hand, and then the cube follows, all you have to do is add a ManipulationHandler to the cube, with default settings:</p><p><img style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20190715/manipultationhandler.png" border="0"></p><p>And then you simply point the 'hand ray' to it, pinch and move:</p><iframe width="650" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0x8370Lc97A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>But as you could see, I can only drag it. I can't move it anymore - or rotate - as my hand comes closer, like at the end of the movie. I fact, I can't do anything anymore.</p><h2>Allow grabbing and moving</h2><p>For that, we will need to add another script: Near Interaction Grabbable. </p><p><img style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20190715/nearinteractiongrabbable.png" border="0"></p><p>And now, if the hand comes close to the cube, you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with it</p><iframe width="650" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ySYBGkQWVs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><h2>Some settings to consider</h2><ul><li>If you don't want to allow 'far manipulation' (the first type) but only want to allow the manipulation by grapping, you can uncheck the "Allow Far Manipulation" on the ManipulationHandler.</li><li>If you want to see where the actual grab connection point is, check the "Show Tether When Manipulating" checkbox on Near Interaction Grabbable. This will look like this:</li></ul><iframe width="560" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OaneY_vuBqk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><p>I bet there are more settings to consider, but I haven't tried those yet (or felt the need to do so).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The code of this completely code-less sample <a href="https://github.com/LocalJoost/MRTK2GrabDemo" target="_blank">can be found here</a>. I can't wait to add code like this to real-world <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens" target="_blank">HoloLens</a> 2 projects. But alas, we still need to wait for the device :)</p>
