<h2>Intro</h2><p>A short one this time – and codeless to. You see, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Mixed-Reality-User-Group/events/262193756/" target="_blank">next Saturday I will be giving an workshop</a> for <a href="https://www.mixug.com/" target="_blank">MixUG</a> Netherlands about development with the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Toolkit 2</a> for Immersive headsets, together with my colleague, partner in crime and fellow MVP <a href="https://www.mixug.com/" target="_blank">Alexander Meijers</a>. One of the things that came up preparing for this workshop was what you would actually need to develop with the Mixed Reality Toolkit 2. Since ye olden days of the HoloToolkit, quite a few things have changed – Unity, the minimal OS version, and there’s even a new version of Visual Studio. So I set out to complete a minimal shopping list with a few optional items. Fortunately, our friends over at Microsoft <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure</a> make it quite simple to spin up a totally pristine machine so you don’t run into the typical developer machine issues – multiple versions of Visual Studio with different workloads and a myriad of Unity versions – which makes it hard to tell sometimes what is required for what app.</p><h2>OS version</h2><p>Easy one. Windows 10, 1809 or (recommended) 1903. Everything I tested, I tested on Windows 10 Pro</p><h2>Visual Studio</h2><p>You will need Visual Studio 2019 community edition. 2017 will work too, but is <em>much</em> slower. <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&amp;rel=16">Download Visual Studio 2019 community from this link</a> and choose the following work loads:</p><ul><li>UWP development with optional components USB connectivity and C++ (V142) UWP tools checked</li><li>Game development with Unity with the optional component 2018.3 64-bit editor <i>unchecked</i></li></ul><p>In images:</p><p><img width="640" height="320" src="https://schaikweb.net/blog/20190729/Workload1.png"></p><p><img width="640" height="321" src="https://schaikweb.net/blog/20190729/Workload2.png"></p><p>Make sure you install Visual Studio <em>before</em> Unity.</p><h2>Offline installer</h2><p>A fun trick – if you want to make an offline installer for the community edition for these particular workloads, open a command prompt after downloading the installer, and type (on one line):</p><p><font face="Consolas">vs_community.exe --layout c:\vsinstaller <br>--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedGame <br>--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Universal <br>--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.IpOverUsb <br>--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.UWP.VC --lang en-US</font></p><p>In c:\vsinstaller you will then find a complete install ‘layout’ for all the necessary components. Might be useful if you want to prepare multiple computers.</p><h2>Unity </h2><p>2018.4.2f1, taken from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/blob/mrtk_development/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt">ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt in the mrtk_development branch</a>. This particular version can be downloaded directly <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&amp;download_nid=62614&amp;os=Win">from this link</a>.<p>Choose as minimal components <ul><li>Unity 2018.4.2f1</li><li>UWP Build Support</li></ul><p><img width="400" height="311" src="https://schaikweb.net/blog/20190729/Unity.PNG"></p><p>Mind you – this sets you op for HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality Immersive headsets <em>only. </em></p><h2>Optional – HoloLens 2 emulator</h2><p>I have already <a href="https://localjoost.github.io/2019/04/17/first-look-at-hololens-2-emulator.html">written extensively about it</a>. You can get it <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2098508">here</a>. Be aware that it requires Hyper-V being installed. If you have installed Windows 10 1903, it will run right away. <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/cannot-run-hololens2-emulator.696779/#post-4664951" target="_blank">On 1809 you will need some trickery</a>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s not that hard to get up and running for MRTK2 development for HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality Immersive headsets. And now you have a nice complete ‘shopping list’ for when you want to prepare your PC.</p>
