<p>In <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/?ocid=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939&amp;WT.mc_id=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> 7, 8 and 8.1 Silverlight apps this is very easy: you just set the Opacity of the Application bar to any value less than 1 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/microsoft.phone.shell.applicationbar.opacity%28v=vs.105%29.aspx" target="_blank">as described here</a>, and the app does not reserve space for the app bar – it just displays the bar on top of the main UI like this:</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Having-the-Application-Bar-.1-Store-Apps_67FC/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Having-the-Application-Bar-.1-Store-Apps_67FC/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="109"></a></p> <p>The problem is, if you set the opacity of what is now called the CommandBar in Windows Phone 8.1 Store apps, the Application bar is translucent indeed - which you can see if you open it - but the apps still reserves space for it in it’s closed state:</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Having-the-Application-Bar-.1-Store-Apps_67FC/image_3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Having-the-Application-Bar-.1-Store-Apps_67FC/image_thumb_3.png" width="244" height="226"></a></p> <p>The fix for this is surprisingly easy, but also pretty hard to find if you don’t know what you are looking for. In the end I got a tip by mail from my famous fellow MVP <a href="https://twitter.com/rudyhuyn" target="_blank">Rudy Huyn</a>. You just add the following, not very obvious line of code to your app. I added it to my App.Xaml.cs, just before the line “Window.Current.Activate();”</p><pre> ApplicationView.GetForCurrentView().SetDesiredBoundsMode(
   ApplicationViewBoundsMode.UseCoreWindow);</pre>
<p>Right. And then you get what you want (as is displayed in the first image). And once you enter this line of code into a search engine, <em>then</em> you find hits enough, dating back to even April. But well, that did not help me much. Hopefully this simple article will save someone else a fruitless seach ;)</p>
<p>To make this code compile, you will need to add a “using Windows.UI.ViewManagement;” on top of your file. And although it is in fact an article about code, I will skip the sample download app this time – for just one line of code it feels like a bit of overkill.</p>
<p>Update – be aware that not only the Application Bar now falls over the UI, <em>but the status bar on top as well</em>. So you may want to take that into account when designing your UI: keep some extra space at the top, or make in partially translucent as wel. Thanks to my fellow MVP <a href="http://twitter.com/skendrot" target="_blank">Shawn Kendrot</a> for pointing me to <a href="http://www.visuallylocated.com/post/2014/04/07/Differences-between-the-new-StatusBar-in-Windows-Phone-XAML-Apps-and-the-SystemTray.aspx" target="_blank">this article</a> that he has written some time ago</p>
