<p>On one of my two PCs running Windows 10 10074 the Phone emulators did not have internet access, which is a bit of a hindrance if you want to write a demo that <em>requires </em>internet access, and after upgrading to VS2015RC from CTP6 I had an even bigger problem: the emulators did not even show up anymore. The only thing I saw was “Start”</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image_thumb.png" width="251" height="78"></a></p> <p>I had inadvertently installed the Android Emulator, and there are apparently some issues with that. No amount of removing selected parts, repairing of modifying could fix it. So I went for the drastic solution: I uninstalled everything that remotely looked like it had something to do with VS2015RC, including the duplicate entry of the <a href="http://windowsphone.com" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> 8.1 emulators.</p> <p>Then I opened the Hyper-V manager, removed all virtual machines there of Windows Phone 8.1 and 10 devices<a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image_3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image_thumb_3.png" width="644" height="405"></a>And I deleted also all virtual switches. Now at one point the Hyper-V manager did not allow me to delete a virtual switch so I went for the bigger kill and removed all of Hyper-V by going into Programs and Features and uninstalling Hyper-V itself, and all the comes with it.</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image_4.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Fixing-emulators-not-showing-up-or-not-h_80BE/image_thumb_4.png" width="397" height="484"></a><br>This requires the PC to reboot. After the reboot, I re-enabled Hyper-V again (which requires another reboot) and then I installed Visual Studio 2015RC again, sans the Android emulator and the cross-platform development kit, and then at last my Windows 10 emulators showed up – and they also now have internet access, albeit it takes them a minute to get it. </p> <p>Your mileage may very, but this worked for me.</p>
