<p>Almost everyone who has programmed something in C# has created an enum at one point or another:</p>  <pre>public enum Whatever
{
  Zero,
  One,
  Two,
  Three
}</pre>
You can cast an enum value to an int - you then get a value assigned by the compiler based upon the order in the enum, so Zero will be 0, One will be 1, etc. If you have a particular sick mind you can add a new chapter to <a href="http://mindprod.com/jgloss/unmain.html" target="_blank">How to write unmaintainable code</a> by creating something like 

<pre>public enum Whatever
{
  One = 5,
  Two = 3,
  Three = 2
}</pre>
But you can also assign values to it using <em>characters</em>. This way, I have created an enumeration that can be used to retrieve tiles from Google servers based upon their enum value without the switch I wrote in my infamous <a href="http://localjoost.github.io/google-maps-for-windows-phone-7" target="_blank">&quot;Google Maps for Windows Phone 7&quot; article</a>. So now you can define the server on which Google stores a particular tile type like this: 

<pre>public enum GoogleType
{
  Street         ='m',
  Hybrid         ='y',
  Satellite      ='s',
  Physical       ='t',
  PhysicalHybrid ='p',
  StreetOverlay  ='h',
  WaterOverlay   ='r'
}</pre>
and then determine the server like this: 

<pre>var server = string.Format(&quot;http://mt{0}.google.com&quot;, (char)GoogleType.Street);</pre>

<p>This makes far cleaner code. </p>
