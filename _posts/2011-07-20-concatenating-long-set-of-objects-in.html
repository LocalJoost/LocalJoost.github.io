<p>It still amazes me when I see people concatenating a long set of repetitive strings with a StringBuilder, adding a separator to each string it, and then remove the last separator – or doing some complex if-statement comparing a count or index to prevent a trailing separator or something. </p>  <p>This is a very simple trick I use a lot of times when I need, for instance, to change a list of points into it’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text" target="_blank">Well Known Text (WKT)</a> representation. So let’s assume we have a variable <em>points</em> of IList&lt;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.point.aspx" target="_blank">System.Windows.Point</a>&gt;, that I want to convert to a list of coordinates that fit in WKT string. That is: X and Y separated by a space, and coordinates separated by a comma. I can do that with this simple statement that would have been a one-liner if it had not been for lack of space ;-) :</p>  <pre>var pointString = 
  string.Join(&quot;, &quot;,
    points.Select(p =&gt; 
      string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, &quot;{0} {1}&quot;, p.X, p.Y)));</pre>

<p>If I had points X=10, Y=15, X=20, Y=25 and X=30 ,Y=40 this would nicely translate to</p>

<p><font face="Courier New">10 15,20 25,30 40</font></p>

<p>That's all. No loops, no truncating trailing comma’s: just a Select and a Join</p>
