<p>One of the customizing features of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone 7</a> is the accent color, which is used to display tiles and certain user interface elements. Default is blue, but I like to play with it (indeed, as the text on the ‘theme’ settings page suggests, to match my mood) and am currently hooked on <font color="#9b00d3"><strike>purple</strike> </font><font color="#00ff00">green</font>. Sue me ;-)</p>  <p>When you use vector data or controls, it is possible to use this color by referring to <strong>PhoneAccentBrush. </strong>For example, if you want a TextBlock’s color to match the accent color, simply add</p>  <pre>Foreground=&quot;{StaticResource PhoneAccentBrush}&quot;</pre>
to the TextBlock. An example of this effect can be seen <a href="http://localjoost.github.io/standard-about-page-for-windows-phone-7" target="_blank">in my previous post</a> - there is the text &quot;About Sample&quot; shown in blue - the default accent color (screen shot way way below at the end of the post) 

<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_QXPoKuE9q6k/TTnuV8rQgsI/AAAAAAAAF48/hyOqyEhIV2U/s1600-h/hand%5B2%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="hand" border="0" alt="hand" align="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_QXPoKuE9q6k/TTnuWWytoQI/AAAAAAAAF5A/PHXYI0HbHis/hand_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="78" height="94" /></a>But it is also possible to show an entire <em>image</em> in the accent color, and it is surprisingly simple. Suppose you want a “thumbs up” image like showed to the right, which I use on the Map Mania credits page. I started out with a simple white-on-transparent background image, and added that to my Windows Phone 7 page like this:</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<pre>&lt;Rectangle Fill=&quot;{StaticResource PhoneAccentBrush}&quot; 
     Width=&quot;55&quot; Height=&quot;68&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Rectangle.OpacityMask&gt;
    &lt;ImageBrush ImageSource=&quot;icons/thumbsup.png&quot; Stretch=&quot;Fill&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/Rectangle.OpacityMask&gt;
&lt;/Rectangle&gt;</pre>

<p>In stead of adding the image directly to your XAML, you add a R<em>ectangle</em> of the same size with a PhoneAccentBrush Fill color, and the image itself as a brush. Presto. Image in accent color – that automatically changes when you change the accent color of your phone. </p>

<p>And that’s all that’s to it. It’s not always complicated architectural things that lighten up your App. ;-)</p>

<b>Update 20-02-2012</b> Is has been brought to my attention that an older post with nearly identical XAML code has appeared earlier <a href="http://accidentalscientist.com/2010/09/colorizing-images-for-windows-phone-7.html">on the "Accidental Scientist"</a> by Simon Cooke. It's uncanny that he even used an identically named image. As my regular readers know I take great pains to link to blog posts or people that inspired me or on whose work I based my examples. For the record: I never saw this blog post when I posted this over a year ago, possibly because of the title, but Mr. Simon Cooke appeared to have this idea earlier than I did. So I hereby acknowledge he has 'prior art credits'.
