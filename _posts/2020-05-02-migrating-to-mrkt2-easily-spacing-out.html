<p><img width="200" height="199" align="right" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20200501/01_menu.png" border="0"></p><h2>Intro</h2><p>This is simple, short but I have to blog it because I discovered this, forgot about it, then discovered it again. So if anything this blog is for informing you as well al to make sure I keep remembering this <em>myself</em>. </p><p>If you have done any UI design for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-mixed-reality" target="_blank">Mixed Reality</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens" target="_blank">HoloLens</a>, you have been in this situation. The initial customer requirement ask for a simple 4 button menu. So you make a neat menu in a 2x2 grid, and are very satisfied with yourself. The next day suddenly you find out you need two more buttons. So - do you make a 2x3 or a 3x2 menu? You decide on the latter, painstakingly arrange them in a nice grid again.</p><p>The day after that, there's 2 more buttons. The day after that, 3 more. And the next day... you discover GridObjectCollection. Or in my case, <em>rediscover</em> it.</p><h2>Simple automatic spacing</h2><p>So here is our simple 2x2 menu in the hierarchy. This is a hand menu. It has has a more complex structure than you would imagine, but this is because I am lazy and want an easily adaptable menu that can be organized by GribObjectCollection</p><p><img width="640" height="309" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20200501/02_structure.png" border="0"></p><p>The point is, everything that needs to be easily organizable by GridObjectCollection, needs to be a child of the object that has the actual GridObjectCollection behaviour attached. In my case that's the empty gameobject "Controls". Now Suppose I want this menu not to be 2x2 but 1 x 4. I simply need to change "Num Rows" into 1, press the "Update Collection" button and presto:</p><p><img style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20200501/03_menu2.png" border="0"></p><p>Of course, you will need to update the background plate and move the header text, but that's a lot less work than changing the layout of these buttons. Another example: change the default setting for "Layout" from "Row Then Column" to "Colum then Row", set "Num Rows" to 1 again (for it will flip to 4 when you change the Layout dropdown) and press "Update Collection" again:</p><p><img style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20200501/04_menu4.png" border="0"></p><p>You can also change how the button spacing by changing Cell Height and Cell Width. For instance, if I have a 4x4 grid and a cell distance width of 0.032 they are perfectly aligned together without any space in between (not recommended for real live scenario's where you are supposed to press these buttons - a mistake is easily made this way)</p><p><img style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; background-image: none;" src="https://www.schaikweb.net/blog/20200501/05_menu5.png" border="0"></p><p>You can also do fun things like having then sorted out by name, child order, and both reversed. Or have them spaced out on not only a flat surface, but on a Cylinder, Sphere or a Radial area. </p><p>Note: the UpdateCollection can also be accessed by code, so you can actually use this script runtime as well. I mainly use it for static layouts.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Don't waste time in manual spacing, use this very handy tool in the editor to make a nice an evenly spaced button menu - or for whatever you need to have laid out. </p><p>Note:</p><ul><li>Make it yourself easy by putting any parts of an UI that should be in a grid in a <em>separate empty game object</em> and put the GridObjectCollection control on that, and place the other parts outside that, so they won't interfere with the layout process.</li><li>You can use this behaviour with any type of game object, not only buttons of course</li><li>More details about GridObjectCollection can be found on <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/Documentation/README_ObjectCollection.html" target="_blank">the documentation page on GitHub</a>. This also handles related behaviours like ScatterObjectCollection and TileObjectCollection.</li></ul><p>No code so no project, although <a href="https://localjoost.github.io/migrating-to-mrtk2-rightleft-swappable" target="_blank">in the next blog post</a> this technique will be applied 'in real life', so to speak. </p>
