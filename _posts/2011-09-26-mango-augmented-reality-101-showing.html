<p>Some things on Windows Phone 7.5 “Mango” are so easy that it’s almost embarrassing. Like showing a running video of what the camera is seeing on the background. So simple, in fact, that no-one ventures to describe it. And consequently, you might spend some fruitless time looking for it. I am therefore very thankful to <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.nl/blogs/mhoekstra/default.aspx" target="_blank">Matthijs Hoekstra</a> for sending me a piece of sample code that I condensed even more.</p> <p>First, you need to make a new Windows Phone application for framework 7.1. In the MainPage.xaml, delete everything between the phone:PhoneApplicationPage, i.e. the complete grid “LayoutRoot”</p> <p>Then, set <strong>SupportedOrientations</strong> and <strong>Orientation</strong> to "Portrait" and&nbsp; <strong>shell:SystemTray.IsVisible</strong> to “False”</p> <p>Then you add the following XAML code:</p><pre>&lt;Rectangle &gt;
  &lt;Rectangle.Fill&gt;
    &lt;VideoBrush x:Name="videoBrush" /&gt;
  &lt;/Rectangle.Fill&gt;
&lt;/Rectangle&gt;</pre>
<p>And then you make sure the following code is in the MainPage.xaml.cs:</p><pre>public MainPage()
{
  InitializeComponent();
  Loaded += MainPage_Loaded;
}

void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
  var cam = new PhotoCamera();
  videoBrush.SetSource(cam);
}</pre>
<p>Deploy the app, and you will see the camera view on your screen. See what I mean by “embarrassingly simple”? Now do something funny with it ;-)</p>
