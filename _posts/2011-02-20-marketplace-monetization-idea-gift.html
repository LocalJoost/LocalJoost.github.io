<p>I seem to be going off-topic a lot these days but I hope you will forgive me for that. </p>  <p>My wife has been eying <a href="http://localjoost.github.io/2011/02/12/htc-7-pro-in-da-house.html" target="_blank">my new HTC 7 Pro</a> quite a lot, especially since I showed her some of her favorite XBox puzzle games on it. I see where this is going to end – sooner or later (and from the looks of it rather sooner than later) her old Nokia phone will be replaced by something that runs <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Phone 7</a> as well. If only because I would like to retain control over my own phone, thank you very much ;-)</p>  <p>And then it started to dawn on me: <em>it would be great to buy gifts for someone else in the </em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/apps/default.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Marketplace</em></a><em>.</em></p>  <p>Suppose I am browsing the Marketplace and find a game or piece of music that I know my wife (or anyone else for what matters) would like very much. I would like to be able to buy the item <i>as a gift</i>, i.e. I pay with <i>my</i> live id, but instead of installing the item on my own device I would get the option to enter <i>someone else’s live id</i>, and a personal note. My wife for instance would then get an e-mail on her live account (“Hi luv look what I got you”) with a Zune link, she clicks on it, the Marketplace recognizes it’s already paid for, and she gets her beloved game. Or a romantic song, or whatever.</p>  <p>I have no idea if this is a possible or even a viable scenario, but the thought crossed my mind yesterday evening (when my wife was watching me play a puzzle game on my phone and all but ripped it from my hands) and I just wanted to share it. </p>  <p>What do you think? Sensible idea, or simply not viable (too complicated for the expected ROI).?</p>
