A very simple one I ran into today - when you are refactoring things, sometimes old methods are no longer required, but for the sake of backward compatiblity your want to retain them. To make sure your <em>own</em> code no longer calls the deprecated method, simply use the ObsoleteAttribute:<pre>[ObsoleteAttribute("Warning you want the compiler to give")]
public void ObsoleteMethod()
{
  // ....
}</pre>If you now recompile your program, every call to ObsoleteMethod displays the message "Warning you want the compiler to give" in the output window - you might want to change that message to something more useful ;-).
