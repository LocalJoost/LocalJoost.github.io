<p>The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/?ocid=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939&amp;WT.mc_id=aff-n-we-loc--ITPRO40939" target="_blank">Windows Phone</a> 8.1 emulator has a beautiful new option: if you want to simulate a route you don’t have to put in a gazillion points anymore, you just input two (or some more if you want specific waypoint), the emulator automatically calculates a route and off you go, in this case from my home to some location near Amsterdam:</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_thumb.png" width="504" height="450"></a></p> <p>Only for some people it does not work out so well. I have seen some reports of people getting this popup, whatever two points they entered, even if those two were very close together with an obvious route:</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_3.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_thumb_3.png" width="304" height="104"></a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Today my friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/qmatteoq" target="_blank">Matteo Pagani</a> ran into the same problem – and using a remote access tool I was able to have a look at his computer and determine once and for all the root cause of this. And it’s very simple – Matteo had set his computer to English like me, but still had the European decimal number setting. For those who are not familiar with that – when an European wants to write “a hundred thousand and a half” he writes “100.000,5” where an American typically writes “100,000.5”. Decimal point and comma are reversed. Whoever thought up this reversal, well let’s stay civilized here but I don’t have very warm feelings toward him or her, let’s put it that way. For some reason, in Geographical Information Systems territory, this is a fairly common problem. I have set my computer to the American number style for longer than I care to remember so I never ran into it. </p> <p>To fix this, you have to adopt the American style of numbers <em>in Windows</em>. Go to your Control Panel, search for number and select “Change date, time or number formats”</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_4.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_thumb_4.png" width="484" height="409"></a></p> <p>Then in the next dialog</p> <p><a href="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_5.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.schaikweb.net/dotnetbyexample/Windows-Phone-emulatorUnable-to-create-a_D3ED/image_thumb_5.png" width="346" height="484"></a></p>   <p>“Decimal symbol” should be set to . (dot) and “Digit grouping symbol” to , (comma). For extra fun, the difference is hard to spot. Close Visual Studio and the emulator, restart Visual Studio, bring up the emulator again, and presto.</p> <p>I know – this affects all programs in Windows so now your Excel sheets will show up in American style. Don’t shoot the messenger, I am just reporting the problem and a work-around. It’s not the end of the world. I don’t think much people will spend days and days simulating routes ;-)</p>
