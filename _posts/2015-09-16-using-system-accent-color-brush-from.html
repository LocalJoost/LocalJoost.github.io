<p>A very short one this time. I wanted to give some UI element the same color as the accent color, but I wanted to use it from <em>code</em>, not from XAML, as written <a href="http://www.firstfloorsoftware.com/news/win10-dev-using-systemaccentcolor" target="_blank">for instance here</a>.</p> <p>Turns out it's called "SystemControlHighlightAccentBrush" and you can use it like this:</p><pre>Brush _blinkBrush = 
  Application.Current.Resources["SystemControlHighlightAccentBrush"] 
    as SolidColorBrush;</pre>
<p>And of course, once you <em>know</em> it's called "SystemControlHighlightAccentBrush" you can find it everywhere, like on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31831917/change-accent-color-in-windows-10-uwp" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. So I am writing this down as much as a personal reminder as for you ;)</p>
<p>I used in my latest IoT <a href="https://github.com/LocalJoost/TemperatureReaderDemo" target="_blank">demo solution that you can find here</a>. It's in project TemperatureReader.ClientApp, class Behaviors.BlinkBehavior.</p>
