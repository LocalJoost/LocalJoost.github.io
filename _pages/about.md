## About this blog

This blog attempts to be a collection of how-to examples in the Microsoft software stack - things that may take forever to find out, especially for the beginner. I see it as my way to return something to the Microsoft community in exchange for what I learned from it. I continue the journey here that I started on [DotNetByExample on Blogger](https://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.com). All content has been migrated to this new blog.

**Motto: talk is cheap, show me the code!**

## About getting support
* Yes, I am more than willing to answer your questions
* Yes, I always read all comments and respond to them if they make sense
* Yes, I am always willing to help you out if you are stuck

But…

* I am not clairvoyant
* I won't write the complete app for your assignment due in three days ;)
* I cannot deduce from a few lines of code or short description how your 1000+ lines project looks like, what you try to do and where things go wrong.
* I am just a simple developer like you who needs to look at code, GoogleB* ing stuff and use the debugger
* I am just a regular guy with a job and my time is limited so it won’t be always today. Sometimes not even tomorrow.
* English is not my first language either

Yet, if something does not work and you really need help and you do this:

* Make a simple solution that shows your problem with as little other stuff in it as possible
* Put it on a OneDrive or some other place where I can download it from
* Explain as clearly as possible what your problem is

I will help you to the best of my abilities. Deal?

I usually make original content, sometimes building upon other people's work. Sometimes I explain things that can be found elsewhere because I felt what I read was not clear enough for my limited mind so I explain it the way it finally clicked with me. In all cases I take great pains to be sure to link to people or articles who deserve the credit. If you think I have shortchanged you on the credits please let me know.

The only power behind it is me and my sometimes runaway passion for parts of Microsoft's technology.
